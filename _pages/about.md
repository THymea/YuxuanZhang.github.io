I am currently a PhD student in electronics at the 
[Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering (DET)](https://www.miun.se/en/meet-mid-sweden-university/Organisation/departments/det/) and [Sensible Things that Communicate (STC) Research Centre](https://www.miun.se/en/Research/research-centers/stc/) at [Mid Sweden University/Mittuniversitetet](https://www.miun.se/en/) (from 2021).

My research interests include miniature machine learning, i.e., implementing machine learning algorithms on low-power and very resource-constrained devices, and the application of TinyML to structural health monitoring as well as inspection (time series signals & visual signals).  

I have published papers in journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, MDPI Sensors, IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS), IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC). 

Currently, I am also a student member of the [IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society](https://ieee-ims.org/).

Background
======
I received my Lic. in electronics from Mid Sweden University (Sweden, 2024), my M.Sc from the [Embedded Systems Engineering](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/f310/embedded-systems-engineering-msc-eng-) program at the University of Leeds (UK, 2019), and my B.Eng. in the New Energy Science & Engineering program at Beijing Information Science & Technology University (China, 2018). After receiving my M.Sc, I was at the [Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ime.cas.cn/) as an assistant engineer for 7 months.



Hobbies
======
Badminton & Cycling
